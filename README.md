# The Lord of the Rings _Timer_

Right, so I wrote this about 4 years ago over a weekend in an attempt to teach myself the basics of JavaScript. It's ruddy awful and doesn't really work properly, but I love it. The frontend got a re-design in 2018, but that's about it. Use it however you want, just don't sell it or anything.

There's a [demo here](https://dazzling-hypatia-36918f.netlify.com/) if you wanna see it in action.
